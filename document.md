Clearly explain what the project is about, its goals, and what everyone hopes to achieve.

### Objectives:
List the specific goals the project aims to achieve and the desired outcomes.

### Scope:
Define what's included and what's not in the project, setting clear boundaries.

### Functional Requirements:
Detail all the things the project should be able to do, such as buttons to click, pages to visit, and information to display.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
Highlight important aspects like speed and data security that the project needs to perform well.

### System Flow Diagrams:
Create diagrams illustrating how information moves through the project, from one screen to another.

### Data Flow Diagrams:
Visualize the flow of information within the project, from the user's device to the project's database.
