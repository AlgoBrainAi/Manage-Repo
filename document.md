# Project Documentation Guide üìÑ

Welcome to the Project Documentation Guide! Here's how you can effectively manage and organize your project documents:

## Company Google Drive üåê

Use the company Google Drive to keep important papers, meeting notes, and backups safe. It's easy to access and collaborate with others!

## Project Documents üìù

### Definition:
Explain clearly what the project is about, its goals, and what everyone hopes to achieve.

### Objectives:
Write down the specific goals the project aims to achieve and what results we're looking for.

### Scope:
Define what's included and what's not in the project.

### Functional Requirements:
List all the things the project should be able to do, like buttons to click, pages to visit, and information to show.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
Talk about important aspects like how fast the project should be or how safe the information needs to be.

### System Flow Diagrams:
Draw pictures showing how information moves through the project, from one screen to another.

### Data Flow Diagrams:
Make diagrams showing how information flows from one part of the project to another, like from the user's computer to the project's database.

### Use Case Diagrams:
Use pictures to show how people will use the project to do things, like logging in or buying something.

Note: We've made sure all these documents are easy to understand, even for clients and non-technical folks! They're written in simple words and have clear pictures to help explain everything about the project.

Feel free to adapt and customize these documents to fit your project's needs!
